# Psychiatric Care Instability — ML Engineering Project

## Goal
Evaluate how different representations of psychiatric care complexity explain
system-level instability (length of stay, medication load) using MIMIC-IV data.

## Scope
- Focus on multi-diagnosis psychiatric admissions
- Models are used as analytical probes, not clinical decision tools
- Emphasis on reproducibility, comparison, and system-level signals

## Structure
- src/step3_baseline: baseline ML models
- src/step4_representation: deep / representation learning
- src/step5_temporal: temporal or structural models (optional)
- data/: external data (not tracked)
- results/: figures and metrics
